<h1>Assassin's Creed Franchise</h1>
<p class="h2">"History is your playground."</p>

    <p>Developed and published by Ubisoft Entertainment SA, a French multinational headquartered in Montreuil, the game series Assassin's Creed is the pride of French gaming industry, boasting exhilarating adventure, wonderful scenery, vast open world, and unforgettable tours backwards in time.</p>

    <p>The games fall under the genre of Action-adventure Stealth, dipicting the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace and equality, and the Templars, who seek power and world domination. The series features historical fiction, science fiction and characters, intertwined with real-world historical events and figures. By September 2016, the series had sold out over 100 million copies across all platforms, ranking itself among the highest selling video game franchises of all time.</p>

    <p>On this page I will introduce the main entries of the franchise, where the player is placed in an open world from third person perspective. Titles I have played myself will feature official introductions and my comments, while the ones I haven't will only have information from their websites, or perhaps some reviews and opinions that have been trending in the Community or on the Internet. First, let's have an overview of the settings and timeline of the games:</p>

    <p>Although this game is released more than a decade ago, its map, graphics and gameplay still remain something we can not hope to see from our domestic gaming industry in another decade. Or maybe two.</p>

    <p>This is my entry point into the franchise, and a brilliant choice at that. To me, one who never knew what open world was, Ubisoft's restoration of the Eternal City upon Seven Hills and its environs and people, was simply astounding. That winter, 2015, I was completely taken by the beauty and possibility of the city. I was atop the Pantheon and the Coliseum. I scaled the decorated walls of the Vatican City. I wandered along the winding course of river Tiber. I read the marks on those Quick Travel wells, <i>SENATVS·POPVLVSQVE·ROMANVS</i>, my first introduction into the language of Latin.</p>
    
    <p>And of course, Ezio's Brotherhood, home for initiates of the Assassins, testimony of his excellent leadership and foresight. Three hundred years later, in the Victorian era, where <i>Syndicate</i> is set, his name is still held sacred on the lips of our heroes. They even re-designed Ezio's clothes for Jacob Frye. </p>

    <p>What's left in my memory of this game is its naval warfare. Battles on the Aegean Sea in <i>Odyssey</i> recently reminds me of the pleasure of firing cannonballs instead of merely arrows towards the enemey, and the security that ships with more than one sail can bring.</p>
    
    <p>I'm seriously considering buying it again.</p>

    <p>Ah, I remember this one well. The young Assassin who turned against the Brotherhood. You may know the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake. Yeah, you are ordered by your Mentor to take an ancient Artifact beneath a cathedral in downtown Lisbon, resulting in the earthquake, killing 90,000 innocent people through your obedience. I still remember jumping across the rubble and the roofs, among horrible fire and countless dead bodies, to escape to safety.</p>
    
    <p>This catastrophe leaves many great thinkers to reflect upon the existence of a benevolent God, including Goethe, with his famous remark, "by destroying the faithful and the sinned together, God does not prove a benevolent Father."</p>
    
    <p>It also leads Shay to question the path of the Assassins. The Templars seek order, and we're against them mainly by beating them to these Artifacts. In the end we have it, and destroy the established order and everyday life of thousands ordinary people. Is this right?</p>
    
    <p>Shay later begins to hunt down his brothers and Mentors. He becomes the Grand Master of the Templar Order, and is still blamed and abhorred two hundred years later in the <i>Syndicate</i> for the fall of the Brotherhood. A truly dark chapter.</p>

    <p>It did what the box said: a true next-gen experience. So true that people were not ready to embrace it, that Ubisoft speedily toned it down.</p>
    
    <p><i>Unity</i> employs the new Anvil engine, a great leap forwards in graphics and a big stride backwards in performance. Upon release, it boasted stunning and incredibly realistic, detailed display, but the mainstream platforms were having difficulties with the high CPU and GPU demand, and the vast majority of players reported awful game experience with loads of bugs as well as antihuman UI. Also, they were upset over the hard lot that befell Arno, who lost his father in the beginning, his Mentor in the middle, and his love in the end.</p>
    
    <p><i>Unity</i> became Ubisoft's Waterloo, so much so that its Season Pass was cancelled, and the game could be purchased at an unprecedently low price.</p>

    <p>London, 1868. The Industrial Revolution unleashes an incredible age of invention, transforming the lives of millions with technologies once thought impossible. Opportunities created during this period have people rushing to London to engage in this new world, a world no longer controlled by kings, emperors, politicians, or religion, but by a new common denominator: money.</p>
    
    <p>Not everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of this boom, however. Despite fueling the engine of the British Empire, workers’ lives are little more than legalized slavery while the top few percent profit from their labor. Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London’s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up.</p>
    
    <p>Introducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in <i>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</i>. Rise to rally and lead the underworld to break the corrupt stranglehold on London in a visceral adventure filled with action, intrigue, and brutal combat.</p>

    <p>My favourite in the series. You may notice, that the images above are different from those of previous titles. That's because I took the actual in-game screenshots myself. There are only three of them because I've got only limited time to make this webpage, otherwise, you'll see at least twenty of 'em.</p>
    
    <p><i>Syndicate</i> is the fruit of Ubisoft's efforts to balance the books. It reverted to the old engine, cut all those demanding features, and redesigned in-game UI. It was developed by Ubisoft Quebec, who provided us with an at least, satisfactory game. Well, "satisfactory" is for others. To me it's perfect.</p>
    
    <p>I love the Victorian era, and London was then the heart of the world, City of Light, with famous writers, brilliant thinkers and legendary scientists. Dickens, Conan Doyle, Darwin, Bell, even Marx himself appeared in the game. Today's London is, of course, much much bigger than its depicted core, still, developers at Quebec did a hell of a great job.</p>

    <p><i>Odyssey</i>, the latest title and the one I'm currently playing. It features a specific Photo Mode, allowing you to take screenshots at almost any moment you please, except during cutscenes. I lost the previous folder where all my shots were kept, and all in the new folder are up there.</p>
    
    <p>Also, it is worth noting that from <i>Origins</i>, the series introduced more RPG elements into the games, doubtly taken from The Wicther 3. This include a vast array of Player Levels, Equipment, and a feature called Auto Level-up, enabling the enemies to automatically level-up as you do, so to keep the game continually interesting and challenging.</p>
    
    <p>Well at least in <i>Origins</i> they design a button to toggle that. In <i>Odyssey</i>, however, due to their wonderful decision to toggle off that toggle, you'll have to face the reality that when you are at Level 99, the cap, the game experience is almost nothing unlike what it is when you first launch it.</p>
    
    <p>(Then why am I still playing it??)</p>
